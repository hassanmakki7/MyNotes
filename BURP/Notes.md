You're using Burp Collaborator wrong.  
  
Don't use Burp's default collaborator instance when testing for out of band vulnerabilities.  
  
Many companies use egress filtering & block outbound traffic to the default collaborator domain [oastify.com](https://oastify.com "https://oastify.com/")  
  
It's worth setting up a private instance:[https://github.com/putsi/privatecollaborator](https://github.com/putsi/privatecollaborator "https://github.com/putsi/privatecollaborator")
