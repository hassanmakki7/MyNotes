Hello Researcher ,

Hello Folks, In this article I will explain my methodology for finding the LFI.

LFI

**What is local file inclusion ??**

_As per the OWASP documentation, the simple definition of LFI is as follows:_

The application allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a “dynamic file inclusion” mechanism implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.

In today’s writeup, I will give you one of the easiest ways to find LFI, we can do the automation with various open source tools, but I always recommend you to perform the manual way as it is very accurate.

Lets hack It

**Let’s get Started**

Before getting into the finding steps, understand the methodology.

**Important Methodology:** Try to surf all the possible pages either manually or with the Burp suite spider option ( after 2020 it was removed and now we have a few alternate options called Content Discovery or Passive Scan ).

But you can also perform automation or fuzzing the URL with waybackurls or gau pattern and try to search the common URL parameter such as redirect=, next=, url=, filename=, file=, and many more.

You can search the same keywords in the Burp suite global search options or you can use the automation tools as specified.

Let’s call the target application a [https://](https://vulnapp.com/)test.com

After manual and auto Recon If you find endpoint this .

Which looks like below:

> [_https://vulnapp.com_](https://vulnapp.com/)_/down_report/?url=https://remoteserver.com_
> 
> [_https://vulnapp.com_](https://vulnapp.com/)_/down_report/?url=../../../../../../etc/passwd_

[http://wWw.******.cOm/index.php?fIle=](http://target/index.php?page=user.php&id=33)album.php&id=21

Try to execute the payload

You can use payload from this site ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emadshanab/LFI-Payload-List/master/LFI%20payloads.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emadshanab/LFI-Payload-List/master/LFI%20payloads.txt), [https://swisskyrepo.github.io/PayloadsAllTheThings/File%20Inclusion/#null-byte](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/PayloadsAllTheThings/File%20Inclusion/#null-byte))

HAPPY HACKING !!!!!!!!
