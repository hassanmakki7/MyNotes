# Lab: [Reflected XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected) with event handlers and `href` attributes blocked

This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability with some whitelisted tags, but all events and anchor `href` attributes are blocked..

To solve the lab, perform a [cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) attack that injects a vector that, when clicked, calls the `alert` function.

Note that you need to label your vector with the word "Click" in order to induce the simulated lab user to click your vector. For example:

`<a href="">Click me</a>`
