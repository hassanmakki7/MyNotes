# Lab: [Reflected XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected) into HTML context with all tags blocked except custom ones

This lab blocks all HTML tags except custom ones.

To solve the lab, perform a [cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) attack that injects a custom tag and automatically alerts `document.cookie`.

 ####  Solution

1. Go to the exploit server and paste the following code, replacing `YOUR-LAB-ID` with your lab ID:
    
    `<script> location = 'https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cxss+id%3Dx+onfocus%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29%20tabindex=1%3E#x'; </script>`
2. Click "Store" and "Deliver exploit to victim".

This injection creates a custom tag with the ID `x`, which contains an `onfocus` event handler that triggers the `alert` function. The hash at the end of the URL focuses on this element as soon as the page is loaded, causing the `alert` payload to be called.
