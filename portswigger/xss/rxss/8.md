# Lab: [Reflected XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected) with [AngularJS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/client-side-template-injection) sandbox escape and [CSP](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/content-security-policy)

This lab uses CSP and AngularJS.

To solve the lab, perform a [cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) attack that bypasses CSP, escapes the AngularJS sandbox, and alerts `document.cookie`.

 ####  Solution

1. Go to the exploit server and paste the following code, replacing `YOUR-LAB-ID` with your lab ID:
    
    `<script> location='https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cinput%20id=x%20ng-focus=$event.composedPath()|orderBy:%27(z=alert)(document.cookie)%27%3E#x'; </script>`
2. Click "Store" and "Deliver exploit to victim".

The exploit uses the `ng-focus` event in AngularJS to create a focus event that bypasses CSP. It also uses `$event`, which is an AngularJS variable that references the event object. The `path` property is specific to Chrome and contains an array of elements that triggered the event. The last element in the array contains the `window` object.

Normally, `|` is a bitwise or operation in JavaScript, but in AngularJS it indicates a filter operation, in this case the `orderBy` filter. The colon signifies an argument that is being sent to the filter. In the argument, instead of calling the `alert` function directly, we assign it to the variable `z`. The function will only be called when the `orderBy` operation reaches the `window` object in the `$event.path` array. This means it can be called in the scope of the window without an explicit reference to the `window` object, effectively bypassing AngularJS's `window` check.
