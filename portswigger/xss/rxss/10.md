# Lab: [Reflected XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected) in a JavaScript URL with some characters blocked

This lab reflects your input in a JavaScript URL, but all is not as it seems. This initially seems like a trivial challenge; however, the application is blocking some characters in an attempt to prevent XSS attacks.

To solve the lab, perform a [cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) attack that calls the `alert` function with the string `1337` contained somewhere in the `alert` message.

 ####  Solution

Visit the following URL, replacing `YOUR-LAB-ID` with your lab ID:

`https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/post?postId=5&%27},x=x=%3E{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337},toString=x,window%2b%27%27,{x:%27`

The lab will be solved, but the alert will only be called if you click "Back to blog" at the bottom of the page.

The exploit uses exception handling to call the `alert` function with arguments. The `throw` statement is used, separated with a blank comment in order to get round the no spaces restriction. The `alert` function is assigned to the `onerror` exception handler.

As `throw` is a statement, it cannot be used as an expression. Instead, we need to use arrow functions to create a block so that the `throw` statement can be used. We then need to call this function, so we assign it to the `toString` property of `window` and trigger this by forcing a string conversion on `window`.
