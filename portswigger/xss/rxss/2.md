# Lab: [Reflected XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected) in canonical link tag

This lab reflects user input in a canonical link tag and escapes angle brackets.

To solve the lab, perform a [cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) attack on the home page that injects an attribute that calls the `alert` function.

To assist with your exploit, you can assume that the simulated user will press the following key combinations:

- `ALT+SHIFT+X`
- `CTRL+ALT+X`
- `Alt+X`

Please note that the intended solution to this lab is only possible in Chrome.

 ####  Solution

1. Visit the following URL, replacing `YOUR-LAB-ID` with your lab ID:
    
    `https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?%27accesskey=%27x%27onclick=%27alert(1)`
    
    This sets the `X` key as an access key for the whole page. When a user presses the access key, the `alert` function is called.
    
2. To trigger the exploit on yourself, press one of the following key combinations:
    - On Windows: `ALT+SHIFT+X`
    - On MacOS: `CTRL+ALT+X`
    - On Linux: `Alt+X`
