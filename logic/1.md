# How to find & access Admin Panel by digging into JS files…

Hello All,🙂

I’m back again with a new write-up…Again this article is about Admin Panel Access…( This is my 5th write-up on Admin Access more on the way…)😄

Few days ago I got an invite on hackerone for a private program.🤔

Consider the company name as “target.com”.

I checked the resolved reports of the program and noticed that 100+ reports have been resolved till now.🙁

Then I decided to not test for common issues like XSS, CRLF, Header Injection etc.😌

I ran wayback urls, gau, & OTX on “target.com” and grabbed all the JS URLs..  
I found thousands of URLs, the main thing is to filter live URLs.

I used the “fff” tool for filtering live URLs (Available on Github).😍

Command I used :  
cat jslist.txt | fff | grep 200 | cut -d “ “ -f1 | tee livejs.txt

It will give you only a live URL.  
After filtering the live URL, I have a total 300+ live JS URLs.

There are 300+ URLs, not all the URLs are useful.

I again filter the URLs using grep method :  
cat livejs.txt | grep dev  
cat livejs.txt | grep app  
cat livejs.txt | grep static  
etc.

Using the above cmnd you’ll get only those URLs which contain “dev”,”app” & “static” etc. words in the url path.  
Eg. In my case vulnerable URL was : [https://target.com/static/js/main.235e6842.chunk.js](https://target.com/static/js/main.235e6842.chunk.js). 🤨

Again I used a tool called “Nemesis” ([https://github.com/machinexa2/Nemesis](https://github.com/machinexa2/Nemesis)).♥️  
Nemesis is a good tool for recon, vulnerabilities, secrets and more! .♥️

Command I used.  
nemesis -u [https://target.com/static/js/main.235e6842.chunk.js](https://target.com/static/js/main.235e6842.chunk.js) -e

It will give me results bunch of information and some HTTPS & HTTP URLs.

I manually open all the URLs on the browser and one URL has a login page. ([https://stagging-dev.target.com](https://stagging-dev.target.com))🤨

I tried all the things: redirect bypass, force browsing, SQL bypass, default credentials brute-force etc. but nothing worked.😀

When I try to brute-force the admin panel my IP gets blocked by cloud-flare.😂

Then I copied that URL and pasted it into my notepad. After some time later my IP gets unblocked.🤪

I tried to find the origin IP behind cloud-flare. I started Shodan search, Censys search etc after that I got the IP address for a particular website. (20.xxx.xxx.x8)😎

Still I’m not sure that IP address belongs to same organization then I open [https://20.xxx.xxx.x8](https://20.xxx.xxx.x8) in browser and it gives me error :

Websites prove their identity via certificates. Firefox does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for 20.xxx.xxx.x8. The certificate is only valid for the following names: *.target.com, target.com. 🥳

The above error confirms that the IP address belongs to the same organization.😋

I opened [https://20.xxx.xxx.x8](https://20.xxx.xxx.x8) on Firefox and clicked on the “Accept the risk and continue” button.

The IP address redirects me to Admin Panel but this time it was “Barracuda system Panel”😉

[https://20.xxx.xxx.x8](https://20.xxx.xxx.x8)[/cgi-mod/index.cgi?locale=en_US](http://20.85.241.18:8000/cgi-mod/index.cgi?locale=en_US)

I entered “admin” in both fields and clicked on the login button.😂

I get access to the admin panel. 😎♥️

In the meantime I didn’t dig more into the panel.

I make a video POC and submit it to the program. The hackerone team triaged the report and updated the severity High 8.3 within an hour.🔥

Reported > Fixed within days > Points…🤩

Always dig more and Never lose your hope..🙂 Make every effort to bypass the login panel..🔥

I hope you enjoyed this article and I apologize for my weak English if there are any mistakes in this post.😅

Thanks for reading my article.😁  
Have a great day…🙂
