Hi! In a recent web pentest project by using business logic, I was able to bypass the one-time password (OTP), leading to an account takeover.

**Discovery Process:**

My journey into this security exploit began with an examination using Burp Suite. As I delved into the application’s login page, I encountered a two-step authentication procedure. In the initial step, users were prompted to enter their phone numbers, this would trigger the generation and transmission of a one-time password (OTP) via SMS for authentication. Subsequently the users would enter the code sent to their phones to login.

While analyzing the packets sent I realized that the input validation was done incorrectly and I could generate a code for different users. To do so I needed to have a proxy in-between the client and server.

**Exploiting the Vulnerability:**

To exploit firstly I selected a target user. Next, with the interception feature of Burp Suite Proxy, I changed the target user’s phone number with my own phone number, triggering the generation of an OTP for my individual device.

Below you can see the image where I entered the target users phone number. Also the HTTP request captured on proxy where the phone number was changed with my number.

After the request was sent an OTP was sent to my device instead of the target user’s phone.

The next phase involved the login process, I entered the targets phone number and the OTP code which was sent to me. Then, with the Burp Suite Intercept, I altered the phone number. This manipulation was a crucial step in allowing me to seamlessly accept the OTP generated for my device.

Below is the image of the login page where I entered the targets phone number and the OTP code which was sent to my device.

By successfully exploiting the business logic, I gained unauthorized access to the targets account.

**Conclusion:**

This incident underscores the significance of business logic and input validation. The application should ensure that only logically valid inputs can be entered and sent. Verifying data on the client side would be incorrect since attackers can gain access using proxies. The developers must validate from the client and the server-side.
