# How Recon helped me to Bypass the Admin Panel.

Hello Friends,

I hope all of you are doing well in Bug Bounty.😄  
I'm happy to share with you about my recent discovery.

How I Bypassed Admin Panel using simple recon.🔥

So let's start,  
Organization does't allow me to share full finding so consider organization as target.com.

I use knockpy for gathering subdomains.😉  
After searching all domains, I decided to target a subdomain which was based on Apache Tomcat.  
"portal.target.com"

I quickly open this domain and it redirects me to the login panel.  
https://portal.target.com/example/wStartUpLogin.jsp

So first I searched for default credentials but it didn’t work.  
Then i put "admin" in both field but same result.🙁  
I tried all methods like SQL payload etc. But didn’t worked..🤔

I wasted 2 to 3 minutes for this process... 😌  
Now It’s Recon time,  
As I already mentioned in my previous article,  
I use duckduckgo as my search engine.😍  
I used simple dork :-  
site:"portal.target.com" -www

In a few seconds I get results and some URLs.

I opened all the URLs in "New Tab" but it redirects me to login page. 🤨

One thing that I noticed here, all the URLs are authenticated so it redirects me directly to the login page.

So i copied all this authenticated url's into my notepad.  
Eg.  
https://portal.target.com/example[/wStuRegPaymentEducServAuthorization.jsp](https://portal.swau.edu/OpenCUAS/wStuRegPaymentEducServAuthorization.jsp)  
https://portal.target.com/example/[wPersDirPersonList.jsp](https://portal.swau.edu/OpenCUAS/wPersDirPersonList.jsp)

Now there is only one way to access this url but I wasn't sure if it would work or not..

I just open "No Redirect" Add-on and enter domain name like this :-  
"https://portal.target.com"

I just visited the authenticated url again and this time it does not redirect me to the login page ... it means I bypassed admin panel..

This organization was related to the university..  
So i able to access all the (students/teachers) information. Like name, email, number and many more information..

And also that I was able to add myself as a student to their university. 😂

Quickly I made a video and reported it to the security team..  
They fixed the issue within 10 minutes.😋

The organization doesn't actually run the bug bounty program, but surprisingly they gave me a $200 reward as a token of appreciation..🤑♥️

Never lose your hope..🙂 Make every effort to bypass the login panel..🔥

I hope you enjoyed this article and i apologize for my weak English if there is any mistakes in this post.😅
