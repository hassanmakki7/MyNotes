# How I Mass hunt for Admin Panel Access…


Hello All,🙂

I’m back again with a new write-up…  
Again this article is about Admin Panel Access…( This is my 6th write-up on Admin Access more on the way…)😄

So let’s start website is “[https://www.delft.nl/](https://www.delft.nl/)".🤪

I gather all the subdomains using my private tools (You can use subfinder , Amass , chaos etc..)😅

I filter live domains using httpx & httprobe.😀

cmd I used :  
cat subdomains | httpx -o urls.txt  
cat subdomains | httproble | sort -u >> list.txt

Now I have many urls. I don’t want to take screenshots and also don’t want to open URLs one by one. That’s why I use the httpx title & status code option.🤔

cmd I used :  
cat list.txt | httpx -title -status-code -fr -o result.txt

Now I have a lot of useful Information with working status code.  
I usually hunt for a login panel. I checked all the titles and one website grabbed my attention which title was “Obsurv — Log In”.😌

I opened this website in my browser “[https://ibor.delft.nl/](https://ibor.delft.nl/)".

Simple Login Page no register option. I tried to bypass the login panel but no luck.🙁

Some guys are really crazy. they contacted me and shared url with me and challenged me to bypass the panel ? Are you serious..!🤨

One thing fits in your mind, Not every panel is vulnerable.😒

So I started fuzzing using ffuf but was not able to get any working directory.🧐

I decided to look into JS files. I used ==Nemesis== for checking secret & hidden URLs / Parameters.🤩

Many people message me regarding Nemesis not working. I am not a developer of Nemesis.😁

Nemesis sample output :

I found a hidden directory using Nemesis “geoserver”.  
When I opened “[https://ibor.delft.nl/geoserver/](https://ibor.delft.nl/geoserver/)" It gave me an error (HTTP Status 403 — Access Denied).😐

Now again I decided to fuzz. I used ffuf cmd I used :  
ffuf -c -u [https://ibor.delft.nl/geoserver/FUZZ](https://ibor.delft.nl/geoserver/FUZZ) -w wordlist.txt -ac

I found /web directory with response 200 OK.

I opened “[https://ibor.delft.nl/geoserver/web/](https://ibor.delft.nl/geoserver/web/)" and found a geoserver welcome page with a login panel.♥️

I searched on google regarding geoserver vulnerabilities and found geoserver default credentials.🤗

I entered Username = admin & password = geoserver

I get access to the admin panel.😎

I make a video POC and submit it to the security team. They offered me awesome swag.♥️😃

I reported same bug to many sites and they already fixed (20+ Maybe not sure abt counting).😏

You can use google dorks for finding geoserver panel (inurl:/geoserver/web/)

Many website still vulnerable. This is bugbounty tip from my side.😋🤩

Always dig more and Never lose your hope..🙂 Make every effort to bypass the login panel..🔥

I hope you enjoyed this article and I apologize for my weak English if there are any mistakes in this post.😅
