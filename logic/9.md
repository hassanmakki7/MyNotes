HIii there, My name is Deep. Iâ€™m a cybersecurity student. This is my first blog. In my writeup if there is any mistakes so pls let me know.

_Story of how I found bug_

One day I was just scrolling in this site where I found my critical bug. And I thought let looks for vulnerability. So I decided to look in register. There I throw some xss payload. But I couldâ€™t find anything there :(. Then, after few minutes I decided to look for admin panel. And I just type /admin after the site url and I got admin panel.

Then, I looked for the database the site was using by wappalyzer. And the site was using mysql database.

Moving forward, immediately I put simple and easy sql payload just besides the admin like this (admin`' OR 1 --)`in the password field whatever you like to enter.

And by chance I got admin panel :). There I found the users mobile no. and email information.

Immediately I decided to report to the organization. However this site was not included in any bb platform. But, bcz of my work and this critical vulnerability I got â‚¹2500(Rupees) as a bounty.
