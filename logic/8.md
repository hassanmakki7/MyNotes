Hello hacker, good to see you in my blog 😄. I hope you are well. In this blog I’m gonna share. How I find email leak vulnerability and earned my first US Dollar bounty on VDP program.

**_Well the story begins._**

One day one of my friend gave me this VDP program to try to find out the bug. As I was free. Then I tried to give an hand on that website. The website I was testing had many subdomains. And also, the main website is quite popular in the US. As I can’t disclose their name publically so I will say this site as an example.com. Moreover, the bug I found was email leaking of the user.

**_How I found this critical bug._**

Firstly, I surfaced the website as an normal user. And checked the all functionality within it. What it was doing and where it was redirecting me when I click on specific link like that…

After looking for the functionality, immediately I moved to test those functionality. So, basically one of the functionality was the following, where I can follow and message the other user.

That’s where I found my valid bug. As I said I can follow or msg to other user. So, I decided to test that message function.

> **_Steps to reproduce the vulnerability:_**
> 
> > First, follow the user and sent message to them.
> 
> > Second, when you sent the message, capture that request (I used burp here).
> 
> > Third, sent that request to the burp repeater.
> 
> And you will see the email which was leaking in the response.
