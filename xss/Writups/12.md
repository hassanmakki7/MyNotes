Hey there, tech enthusiasts and bug-hunting buddies!

Prepare yourselves for a tale that’s part mystery and all about how I stumbled upon my first $1000 in the wild world of bug bounties. Scratch your heads, and maybe even pick up a trick or two along the way.

**Chapter One: The Curious Coder’s Call to Adventure**

Once upon a pixelated time, I was just your average curious coder, surfing through the waves of the web. And then, like a message from the digital heavens, I discovered the legendary bug bounty program of Company X. With dollar signs in my eyes and curiosity in my heart, I embarked on an adventure of a lifetime.

**Chapter Two: Unmasking the Mysterious XSS Beast**

Now, here’s where things get interesting — I stumbled upon a vulnerability called reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). But this wasn’t your run-of-the-mill vulnerability. Oh no! It was like a puzzle wrapped in an enigma, hidden within a virtual Rubik’s Cube. This bug was an elusive escape artist, a bypass of a trap that had confounded a previous hunter. My mission? To crack the code and claim the prize.

**Chapter Three: The “Sanitization” Shuffle**

Enter the dragon — or should I say, the sanitization dragon. This beast was the guardian of the gates, the defender of the digital realm, armed with the power to scrub away all the “bad stuff.” Characters like `<` and `>` were its sworn enemies, but I was determined to outwit it.

**Chapter Four: The Hilarious Hypothesis**

So there I was, sipping on virtual coffee and staring at my screen like a detective in a cheesy detective movie. How do I fool the sanitization dragon? Well, I had a brilliant idea — what if I sent it a bunch of characters, like quotes and angle brackets, to see how it reacted? Imagine me typing away, sending in quotes and saying, “Let’s see what you got, dragon!”

**Chapter Five: The Unexpected Discovery**

After an entertaining 30 minutes of character warfare, I hit the jackpot. `<img src=x>` was like a dud firework, but `"><img src=x>`? Oh boy, the dragon fell for that one! Victory dance, anyone? The server gobbled up that angle bracket like it was candy. And that's when the light bulb in my head went _ding_ - I was onto something big.

**Chapter Six: Cracking the Code**

Now, with the dragon’s weakness in hand, it was time for the real fun. I concocted a sneaky payload: `"><<x>test>`. Guess what? The screen blurted out `"><test>`. Comedy gold! It was like the server had a sense of humor. But the real punchline was yet to come.

**Chapter Seven: The Hilarious Payload Showdown**

Drumroll, please! I summoned my ultimate payload: `"><<x>img/src/onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`. My heart raced as I hit enter, imagining a little digital performance on the server's stage. And there it was - the alert box popped up like a surprise party, showing off the server's secrets in all their glory. Victory was sweet, and the laughter was even sweeter.

**Epilogue: Seizing the Opportunity**

Oh, but wait, there’s more! One last twist in this tale. Remember that payload I sent, `"><<x>">`? Something magical happened there. The server sanitization played a little trick, focusing only on the `<x>` part and conveniently ignoring the first `<` because it wasn't closed yet. And that's when I saw my chance - the door left ajar, the opportunity to enter the payload and expose the vulnerability.

And as you peek into the mechanics of the payload, a curious absence stands out — no space. Ah, the elusive space, the bane of many a hacker’s existence! But fear not, for in this realm, we hold the key to bypassing that space — a simple `/` character. Yes, you see, when I sent `<img src=x>`, the server sanitized it without mercy. Yet, when I crafted `<img/src/onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`, the server let it slip by untouched. A quirk in the system, an anomaly in the matrix, but one I eagerly seized upon.

So there you have it, my fellow adventurers! My journey to snag that coveted $1000 was a rollercoaster of quirky characters, epic showdowns with a sanitization dragon. As you venture forth into the bug bounty wilderness, remember to keep your wits sharp and your humor sharper. Until next time, happy coding and bug hunting!
