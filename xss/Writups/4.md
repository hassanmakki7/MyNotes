HIi hackers, good to see you in my blog ;) Today I’m gonna share three critical vulnerability which I found in one site. The first one is XSS, second is OTP bypass and third is account takeover by forgot password.

So let’s get started.

One day I was just free from my study. And decided to look for the vulnerability in random sites. And I came across one matrimony sites also I always tried to look for the new types of vulnerability in matrimony sites. Bcz most of the matrimony sites are too vulnerable which I believe that.

So, moving further, first vulnerability I came across was the XSS. However whenever we see search parameter we always throw XSS payload. So also I’ve done the same.

**?username_search=<script>alert(1)</script>**

username search parameter was passed so I throw the simple payload. But that url was sanitizing malicious characters and also I throw some new types of payload but it didn’t work ☹. Then I was loosing little bit hope. But again I decided to look for the other parameter.

However by surprise I found the XSS, this XSS was I found in this parameter **(profile_details.php?userid=)** where I just put simple payload(<script>alert(1)</script>) and it was throwing me error.

So now I was sure by putting payload in the url and sent to the victim. I could takeover the account.

Then I thought instead of taking users account by XSS, I set my goal to look for the vulnerability which could give me direct access to account without user interaction.

So again my journey begins to look account takeover vulnerability.

That’s where I came across my second vulnerability OTP bypass. However this vulnerability was quite easy to find.

First I went to the forgot password functionality. So I can change another users password which can leads to my goal(Account Take Over). There I enter my phone number. And after that I capture the successful login request. Which I sent to the repeater. And you can see the response below.

In this response it was easy to understand.

So, again I went to the password reset functionality, enter my phone number and enter wrong otp and capture the request.

When I intercept the response of the wrong otp request. So, it was only showing me Invalid pin as you can see in the above image, there I paste the previous successful otp response parameter.

As I thought OTP was bypass and I was happy :)

But when I realized that this OTP bypass can’t lead to my account takeover goal. Because to bypass the OTP, atleast I should have the victim’s phone number. Which I can’t access without premium user :( It makes me feel sad bcz even after finding OTP bypass bug I couldn’t able to takeover any user account. After finding this bug I turn off my laptop and slept on my bed as it was late night 😴.

On the very next day with fresh mind, again I was focusing on my account takeover goal.

First, I created two account on my two different gmail and moblie number.

Then, in that site from the beginning I started to capture the request. Look for the minor parameter.

By looking at minor parameter I found one parameter which was username ID. And also in forgot password functionality I could change password by just my user ID.

So, I only had one chance to change another user password by it’s username ID which I could easily get by surfing their profile.

So in forgot password functionality when I add my profile ID and then capture the request. It was look something like this. Where in the username my ID was being sent to the server.

Then I decided to put the my another account ID there and in the password it was admin@123 which I already set. And entering the my other account ID there and sent the request to the server.

And by surprised I was able to change the account password 😃. That time I was feeling over the moon bcz I finally achieved my little goal of taking another user account.
