# How i was able to exploit the same endpoint 2 times ( multiple xss & open Redirection on 10 subdomain)
Hello all,

This is my second article, so if there is any type of mistake in it forgive me.🙄

I want to share my recent discovery of how i was able to exploit the same endpoint 2 times ( multiple xss & open Redirection on 10 subdomain )🤗

One day i was checking my linkedin feed and i saw that one of my friend got rewarded from this site. 😮

I was thinking that i should try my luck if my friend forgot to report any Vulnerability, it is good for me and i’ll report it. 🤓

All of you know that,

I never target a domain, i always target subdomain..😅

I used dnsdumpster.com for basic recon,😄

I opened dnsdumpster.com and enter domain name ( eg. sanity.io )& hit search button. In few seconds, i got the subdomains of sanity.io.🤩

It is the best tool for basic recon, its response time is very fast.😍

Then i decided to target “api.sanity.io”

Without wasting any time, i opened “api.sanity.io” and it has quickly redireted me to :- https://accounts.sanity.io/login/redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.sanity.io%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%3Fresponse_type%3Dcode%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapi.sanity.io%252Fv1%252Fauth%252Fcallback%252Fsanity%26state%3Du3vRNiBfJA4DvEwolSJbPKYF%26client_id%3Doc-3I2pHriWuK29

I was thinking… hmmmmmmm…

Site is Redirecting me to login page… 🤔

But i decided to target “api.sanity.io” 😌 so this time i again opened “api.sanity.io” and quickly copy URL into notepad..

https://api.sanity.io/v1/auth/whitelist?redirectTo=https://accounts.sanity.io/login/redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.sanity.io%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%3Fresponse_type%3Dcode%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapi.sanity.io%252Fv1%252Fauth%252Fcallback%252Fsanity%26state%3Du3vRNiBfJA4DvEwolSJbPKYF%26client_id%3Doc-3I2pHriWuK29

Then i saw “?redirectTo=” and i was excited, The First thought comes to my mind to test for open redirection.🤪

I entered http://evil.com after “?redirectTo=” but nothing happened it’s showing 404 error.. 😕

Then i was thinking what to do now, the second thought comes to my mind why not test XSS there.

After “?redirectTo=” i entered some basic paylods ( eg. img & svg alert (1) )

But nothing worked..🙁

Then i opened the Source code tab to see what is happening in the background when i am entering this payload but the payload is not reflecting back. 🙄

Now i was like XSS is not present there..🤔

I was looking at the source code one more time and suddenly i remembered my recent discovery in braze.com. the same situation input is not reflected in the Source code, but it was reflecting when i inspected the element of the page. ☺️

I inspect the element of that error page, searched for my input and it’s reflecting but XSS is not working..😅

Then i was wondering why this happens to me every time..😆

Then i was trying one more time for xss and this time enter the “prompt” payload instead of alert. 😛

URL :- https://api.sanity.io/v1/auth/whitelist?redirectTo=XSS_Payload

And you know what XSS is triggered..😆

After i realised that the alert is blocked that’s why XSS is not triggered. 😁

Then i laughed on myself that how dumb is me..😂🤣

I am thinking that i have now got xss why not to hunt more bugs on this site.😃

Then again recon process 😕

I used knockpy for finding subdomain, after some time later i got subdomains of subdomain.. 😲

Eg.  
[https://1goh1ap5.api.sanity.io](https://1goh1ap5.api.sanity.io/)/  
[https://v475t82f.api.sanity.io](https://v475t82f.api.sanity.io/)/  
[https://w7l5ei8i.api.sanity.io](https://w7l5ei8i.api.sanity.io/)/  
[https://wb68e9ma.api.sanity.io](https://wb68e9ma.api.sanity.io/)/

And this subdomains also redirecting me to " [https://accounts.sanity.io/login](https://accounts.sanity.io/login) " 😆  
Then i was like wow...😮  
I just entered xss payload again to "? redirectTO=" and XSS is triggered... 🤩

https://1goh1ap5.api.sanity.io/v1/auth/whitelist?redirectTo=XSS_Payload

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*QlmDzRcUm0BTeV68Oef8SA.png)

I found multiple xss on [sanity.io](http://sanity.io/) ( 10 subdomain is affected for this XSS )

Immediately I reported the issue to the Sec. Team, in few days they fixed the issue and rewarded me... 🤑🤑🤑

After 7 days, I was open "[api.sanity.io](http://api.sanity.io/)" again, but this time it was not redirecting me to any page.. 🧐  
But when I reopen the Vulnerable URL it does not show any pop-up or error.  
Eg. [https://api.sanity.io/v1/auth/whitelist?redirectTo](https://api.sanity.io/v1/auth/whitelist?redirectTo=)=

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*v9uqlnSVSaOjiRIYgIYtyQ.png)

This time the page showing me "Login Button" 😆  
Now, Mann me laddu futaa..😂 🤣  
And Guess what, i entered evil.com after "?redirectTO=" and click on "Login Button" it will redirect me to evil.com... 🤩🤩  
And this time i entered xss paylod instead of evil.com.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*RSTe47goUy68IDjm5Pu6nQ.png)

And hit the "Login Button" and XSS triggered again...😆  
As you read in the above section I found multiple reflected XSS on 10 subdomain.  
Then i don’t have to explain more, Again all the subdomains are Vulnerable to this issue. 🤩

I report this issue to the team, and they also fixed the issue..😗
