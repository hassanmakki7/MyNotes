# How I Found My First Bug | XSS

Today I’m going to talk about how I found my first bug on a website and I hope this article can help others to find their first bug too.

**بِسْمِ اللَّـهِ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ  
**Let’s get started.

First I was reading a write-up on how to find your first bug, which discussed using Google dorks to find vulnerable parameters.

The writer listed some Google dorks for finding vulnerable parameters; one of them was :

inurl:index.php?id=

So simply I copied it and pasted it into the browser and searched for it.

After some searching and testing various parameters on websites I found the chosen website :D

Then I opened my burp and sent the request to the Intruder, adding the **§** mark where I wanted my payloads to run,

and loaded some **XSS** payloads from [Cross Site Scripting ( XSS ) Vulnerability Payload List](https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list) and started the attack.

payload list

After testing some payloads, I stopped the process and felt that the eighth payload was the one because I had been reviewing the source code and realized that this payload is appropriate since the **form** tag needs to be closed first.

the payload:  
"onclick=prompt(8)><svg/onload=prompt(8)>"@x.y

the response in the intruder attack

I right-clicked and showed response in browser and **BOOM!!** IT ACTUALLY WORKED!!

Sadly.. after some research about this website, I found that someone had already discovered it before, but it was a great experience.

In conclusion, I hope my explanation was clear.
