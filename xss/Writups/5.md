HIII HACKERS, My name is Deep and Iâ€™m cybersecurity researcher and bug hunter. In this blog Iâ€™m gonna show you how I accidently find XSS(cross site-scripting)vulnerability in search parameter.

So letâ€™s get started.

As I was surfing the site. That time my only motive was to look for the IDOR vulnerability. As we know there is also possibility of finding IDOR in the URL parameter by changing some key words like(ID=1,2). So Iâ€™ve done the same. I tried to change the number in the URL. But it didnâ€™t work. Then I saw this cm=(it was in the URL) there I tried putting some random stuff like â€˜helloâ€™ or â€˜testingâ€™. So, those words was reflecting back to the page!!.

Then you know guys the game. I put XSS payload there and yeahh I got alert!

As I know this page was affected to XSS, so I tried some another types of payload to see how the application react. You can get all types of XSS payload from below link.

There I tried to test this payload to see how it was reacting.

**Payload:-**Â `**"><h1><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sxvccpasgTE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>123</h1>**`

The payload is about adding youtube video in the site.

In the payload you can the change the width and height of the video as you like.

And yeahh, as you can see in the page I was able to add youtube video. It means that the site was not sanitizing user input at all.

So thatâ€™s it guys. If Iâ€™ve made any mistakes in my writing so let me know or if you have any question feel free to ask me.
