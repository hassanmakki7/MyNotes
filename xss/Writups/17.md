How I discovered post based xss vulnerability at Hacker one

Hello guys,

This my second report I will sharing you..

First of all,

What is post based xss?

Post-Based XSS (Cross-site scripting) is a security vulnerability in web applications that allows attackers to inject XSS code into data submitted via an HTTP POST request, which is then used to display malicious content on the targeted web page. This vulnerability is considered dangerous because it allows attackers to execute malicious policies on user accounts on the affected website or to steal user data stored on the server.

This vulnerability differs from GET-Based XSS, as it is carried out through the form data submitted via a POST request instead of a GET request. POST requests are commonly used to transfer sensitive data such as passwords and other personal information, which means that Post-Based XSS may be more dangerous in some cases.

I found this vulnerability at login page in the parameter call “username"

With this payload :

KaOdcRYSw6jhu"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>vzsui

Tips &Trick:

always check for this vulnerability in your burpsuite or zap proxy tool..

Because this type doesn’t appear to injectble “print the payload".

You can use repeater in burpsuite to inject payload and take the response to your browser and happy hacking.
