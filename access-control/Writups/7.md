Proof of Concept (PoC)

Hello everyone,

In this post, I will show you how I discovered a vulnerability that allows a malicious user could change the password for other users which could lead to an account takeover. On another note, I also found that the forgot password token is not invalidated after use.

## Who is the target?

> Wardah Cosmetics or Wardah is a brand of beauty products produced by one of the largest cosmetic manufacturing companies in Indonesia.

At the time I reported the issue, Wardah not currently opening a bug bounty, but there can be exceptions if the vulnerability is triaged and validated as high to critical. It seems that the Bug Bounty Program (BBP) is not a public program & only opens at a certain time.

> I had a positive impression of Wardah security team swift response to my bug report submissions. They consistently demonstrates excellent communication. Their prompt responses, clear explanations, and proactive updates contribute significantly to our collaborative efforts in maintaining a secure environment.

## Steps To Reproduce

> For the tools, we can use Chrome & Postman.

[1] Create 2 users `attacker` and `victim`, let’s say the `userid` for `attacker` is `111111` & for `victim` is `222222`.

[2] As `attacker`, go to the [Login page](https://www.wardahbeauty.com/id/sign-in) & click on the `FORGOT PASSWORD` link.

[3] As `attacker`, fill in the `E-mail` & check the reCAPTCHA then click the `SEND RESET LINK` button.

[4] As `attacker`, we will receive an email for `Password Recovery`, click on the `Recover Your Password` button. The link will look like this `https://www.wardahbeauty.com/id/auth/recovery/b5ef0ca049e9b44c98d9d989240d2836b2XXX`. We assume that `b5ef0ca049e9b44c98d9d989240d2836b2XXXXXX` is our forgot password token.

5. As `attacker`, fill in the new password & click the `Submit` button, we’ve successfully reset our password.

6. As `attacker`, we’ll look at the API request from the Network tab in Chrome, it will look like this:

Request:

POST https://www.wardahbeauty.com/auth/recovery_process  
  
Body:  
id: "99999"  
userid: "111111"  
password: "NEWPASSWORD"  
passwordconfirm: "NEWPASSWORD"

We can see that alongside the password, we also send the `id` & `userid`. Our assumptions are:

- `id` is the forgot password id (`99999`), which is mapped from the forgot password token `b5ef0ca049e9b44c98d9d989240d2836b2XXXXXX`
- `userid` is the target user ID that we want to reset.

Response:

{  
    "code": 200,  
    "msg": "Your password has been reset, please login to continue",  
    "directurl": "https://www.wardahbeauty.com/id"  
}

[7] Now as `attacker`, let’s try to change the `userid` param with `victim` `userid`, in this case `222222`.

Request:

POST https://www.wardahbeauty.com/auth/recovery_process  
  
Body:  
id: "99999"  
userid: "222222"  
password: "NEWPASSWORD"  
passwordconfirm: "NEWPASSWORD"

Response:

{  
    "code": 200,  
    "msg": "Your password has been reset, please login to continue",  
    "directurl": "https://www.wardahbeauty.com/id"  
}

Surprisingly, we are able to change the password for the `victim`.

[8] To confirm that we successfully changed the password of the `victim`, we can go to the [Login page](https://www.wardahbeauty.com/id/sign-in) & log in with the `victim` account using the new password.

## Mitigation

1. Perform proper authorization/ access control on the affected endpoints, by pairing/ matching the forgot password `id` or `token` to the original `userid`.
2. On another note, I also found that we are able to perform the forgot password multiple times using the same `id` or `token`, this can be dangerous if an attacker somehow gains the victim's email account access and finds the forgot password token in emails. Forgot password token should expire immediately after use, automatically expire after the issuance of new ones, and use a certain living span (e.g. 6 hours).

## Impact

1. An attacker could change the password for every user & perform an account takeover.
2. An attacker could take over the victim's account if he somehow gains the victim's email account access and finds a forgot password token in emails.

## Timeline

- [14/01/2024] Contact the security team via LinkedIn
- [30/01/2024] The security team responded & asked to send the report via email
- [01/02/2024] Send the report via Email
- [05/02/2024] Asking for public disclosure
- [12/02/2024] Issue triage & considered as critical. Public disclosure is allowed after the bug is patched.
- [12/02/2024] Receive a certificate of appreciation
- [13/03/2024] Bounty received US$65
- [19/03/2024] Re-test done & confirmed that the issue has been resolved.
