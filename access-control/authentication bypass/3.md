So Boring Day start will a cup of Tea and a target domain , As we all bug hunter do, First selecting the target and testing whole day . But It is more complicated when the website have high security barrier .

Lets understand the vulnerability:

Suppose there is Account A and Account B , Account A invite an user to join his/her members whose email was(cegim71944@dovesilo.com) , And In the same time Account B was also inviting the same user (cegim71944@dovesilo.com)
