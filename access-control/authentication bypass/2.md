Hello Readers,

My name is Ashish rai , I‚Äôam a security researcher and bug hunter I have secured more that 50 + organizations. I have been learning these vulnerabilities and sharing my insights with you, as well as practicing for myself. As I mentioned in my last post, about my finding it turned out to be a duplicate one againü•≤. But no issues, let us keep practicing and one day we will get it. Okay, talks aside. Let us today learn about Token Leakage. This can be found out in unique ways. We will learn both ways. Without any due let us dive into our maze.

lets start

# What is a Token

First, let us know what is a token. In digital terms, a token is a piece of information issued for a particular work. For example, in customer service when we raise an issue we will be provided a token or kind of a ticket to keep track of our issue. Such are called tokens, they are helpful to keep track of our information/issue or whatever purpose it is issued for. It is a special one(confidential) if it is being used for some sensitive information travel.

So by the term Token Leakage, you would have understood that the token is being leaked, and as we have already been known that nothing in this digital space is useless and everything can be used against something. So this token contains information that can be vulnerable. So it is our duty to make sure that such critical information is not being sent out.

The two ways in which such token leakage can be found are via Host Header and via Referrer. Let us learn both of them in brief.

Today I will expalin How I Found this unique bug in Bugcrowd program .

# Token Leakage via Referrer

This can again happen in 3 ways

1. Trusted 3rd party ‚Äî P5
2. Untrusted 3rd party ‚Äî P4
3. Over HTTP ‚Äî P4

Today I will show you 2 Number Which is Untrusted 3rd party

# Description

While Testing reset password functionality, It has been identified that the application is leaking Token to third party sites. In this case it was found that the Token is being leaked to third party sites which is a issue knowing the fact that it can allow any malicious users to use the reset password of user.

How you can test this type of Vulnerability :-

# Reproduction Instructions /

1. Send reset password link to your email address.
2. 2)Now go to email, turn burp suite intercept on and click on reset password link. Check for the requests having the token in ‚Äúhost and url ‚Äù as third party website. And copy the link
3. 3)Now turn intercept off and reset the password.(with that link)
4. 4)Now reset the password.

password reset token leak in Third part url

# Additional Information:

Note also that if users can author content within the application then an attacker may be able to inject links referring to a domain they control in order to capture data from URLs used within the application.

Leak In Third party Host

# Impact

As you can see in the Host and url the reset token is getting leaked to third party sites. So, the person who has the complete control over that particular third party site can Use the Token easily.

# Additional :

The Referrer & Host and url header does not need a user interaction i.e. clicking the third party link. All the links are instantaneously transferred without any dependence on some other action.
