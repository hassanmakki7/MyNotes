**How I found it ?**

I had been diligently searching through the program for a considerable amount of time, identifying numerous bugs of varying severity levels — low, medium, and high. Despite my persistent efforts to locate a critical vulnerability, I was almost ready to abandon the endeavor. However, just as I was on the brink of giving up, I chanced upon a login page. Almost impulsively, I entered a single quote (‘) into one of the input fields, fully expecting that nothing would happen — no error or any noticeable change on the login page. To my surprise, though, the application threw an error, as indicated in the response captured by Burp Suite.
