Hi everyone, I am an Independent Cyber Security Researcher and a Red Team Member of SYNACK from Bangladesh.

I recently got invited to a private program, and it had allowed to be hunted on all the assets that belongs to them. I asked my friend 

[Ansar Uddin](https://medium.com/u/d0e9c5b1742e?source=post_page-----486770af75a6--------------------------------)

 to collaborate with me, and we immediately started hunting on the assets we’ve found through recon.

We’ve come across a domain where we started testing on all input fields. Since it allowed us to create free user accounts, and after that, we’ve started checking inside functionalities. We’ve noticed that when we created a file and while deleting it, we’ve used a SQLI blind payload, and it slept for 5 seconds since the sleep(5). We used it again and it did not work. It is because the file we’ve created has been deleted.

We created another file, and performed the same process, and it successfully slept again, and finally, we had to create another file and while deleting it, we captured the request, and used SQLMAP, and it had found all the available databases.

Payload used: ‘ AND (SELECT 8839 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))uzIY) AND ‘mSUA’=’mSUA

**The vulnerable delete request looked liked this:**

**After using SQLI blind payload:**

Rewarded $1300

**Important Tip**: Do not fuzz on delete request, rather, check each parameters manually.
