Hello Researchers,

My name is Ashish Rai, And Iam a security researcher and bug hunter , Today Iam going to share a new vulnerability which is popular by world wide (SQL INJECTION ATTACK).

Lets start:

start

I will try to expain in easy way, Day begin and I started hunting in random domain , so while Today I was thinking to exploit critical vulnerabilty but It was not easy as I think (moye moye ). So my first step was to find a juicy domain after that I used Google dorking to find some juicy content . (you can use this line inurl site.com/admin.php) to find some juicy information about that particular domain .

After dorking an hour I have got admin panel url (https://target.com/admin/login). So I knew that php is used for backend for that particular webiste , So I tryed to access with default username and passoword (password , password, admin, admin, admin, password ) . But nothing happens . Now I think about sql attack because webiste is made by php and we all know php have lots of vulnerability .

Lets exploit It,

Step to Reproduce:

1> Go to your burpsuite and on intercept

2> Now In username and password field enter this payload (‘ or 1=1 — ) in both username and password field. [If you want to know about this payload then visit [https://medium.com/@AhmedMhesham/sqli-navigating-the-perils-of-or-1-1-payloads-e4a8c33c9895#:~:text=In%20this%20blog%2C%20we're,manipulate%20databases%20through%20web%20applications](https://medium.com/@AhmedMhesham/sqli-navigating-the-perils-of-or-1-1-payloads-e4a8c33c9895#:~:text=In%20this%20blog%2C%20we%27re,manipulate%20databases%20through%20web%20applications).)

3> Now intercept the request and capture and send to repeater .

4> Admin panel access is now in your my hand .
