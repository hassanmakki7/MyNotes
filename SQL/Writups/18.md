Good day Hackers,

Iâ€™d like to appreciate God for helping me find this bug and Iâ€™ll be sharing how I was able to do so.

# **What is SQL Injection?**

SQL injection is a type of web application security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can input malicious SQL statements into an applicationâ€™s input fields. This type of attack takes advantage of the fact that many web applications accept user input without properly validating or sanitizing it.

# **Summary**

I got subdomains of my target and then visited one of the endpoints which was a login page. While I was on the page, I checked theÂ [DotGit Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dotgit/pampamgoihgcedonnphgehgondkhikel?hl=en)Â and I got a message about an exposed Git repository on the site. I clicked on it, and the .git/index directory was downloaded.

I viewed the file and behold, a huge number of unauthenticated directories were exposed. I tried my best to visit each endpoint but one of them stood out. It disclosed a MySQL error message:

After asking for help on Twitter, I finally had an idea of what to do. I began by adding theÂ **_nom_hachage_**Â parameter to the URL and it was like:

https://target.com/endpoint.php?nom_hachage='

The error message immediately changed to the content that was in theÂ **_nom_hachage_**Â parameter.

I sent the whole request to bothÂ [Ghauri](https://github.com/r0oth3x49/ghauri)Â andÂ [Sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap):

ghauri -u https://target.com/endpoint.php?nom_hachage=1 --dbs

python3 sqlmap.py -u https://target.com/endpoint.php?nom_hachage=1

Ghauri was able to retrieve the database name and user in less than 15 minutes while Sqlmap is still looking for an exploitðŸ˜‚.
