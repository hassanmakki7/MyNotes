**Understanding example.info**

Example.info is a well-established platform that empowers users to compare energy plans and providers effortlessly. Through its user-friendly interface and wealth of information, example.info offers a valuable service, enabling consumers to make informed decisions about their energy needs.

**Discovery of the Vulnerability**

Understanding the importance of thorough reconnaissance, I continued my exploration of the website, determined to uncover any hidden vulnerabilities. This meticulous approach led me to discover unexplored parts of example.info, increasing the likelihood of finding potential security weaknesses.

> My excitement surged as I began my security assessment, leveraging parameter finding tools to analyze example.info. Among the parameters, `professionnels` caught my attention, and I decided to test it for possible vulnerabilities. Armed with simple SQL injection techniques, I attempted to inject payloads into the parameter.As I delved deeper into my testing, I decided to experiment with the “sleep” command to induce a response delay. The sleep query justified that the parameter was vulnerable to SQL injection, as the backend database, MySQL, responded with noticeable delays — a clear indication of a potential time-based SQL injection vulnerability. My first breakthrough was underway. :)

**Using SQLMap for Comprehensive Exploitation**

To confirm the extent of the vulnerability, I turned to SQLMap, a powerful automated SQL injection tool. With SQLMap’s capabilities, I dove deeper into the website’s database, leaving no stone unturned. The tool not only validated the time-based SQL injection vulnerability but also allowed me to extract sensitive data and manipulate energy plan prices — an eye-opening revelation with serious implications.

The gravity of this vulnerability cannot be underestimated. In the wrong hands, the ability to manipulate energy prices and deceive customers could have resulted in financial losses and irreparable damage to example.info’s reputation. Responsible disclosure became my top priority to prevent such dire outcomes.

**Responsible Disclosure and Bounty Reward**

Recognizing the urgency of the matter, I immediately reported my findings to the example.info team, providing them with a detailed breakdown of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and its potential impact.

> In acknowledgement of my responsible disclosure and the severity of the vulnerability, example.info awarded me my first-ever bounty — a reward of €500. It’s true that the payment could be higher, but the severity of the issue was carefully assessed. Since the app does not store any customer data or other valuable information, the bounty amount was set accordingly.

**Takeaways**

Reconnaissance played a pivotal role in uncovering hidden vulnerabilities, emphasizing the significance of a comprehensive security assessment. The most significant takeaway from this finding is undeniable importance of reconnaissance. Thoroughly understanding the target platform and identifying potential weak points are essential in uncovering vulnerabilities.
