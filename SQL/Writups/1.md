# Steps to Reproduce:


1. The activity which caught my attention is the **EMP_ID** parameter after trying to login using the random values.

2. The discovered endpoint was **/api/business/business_kpi** which was having the employee ID parameter.

3. There I tried to add the “ **’** ”, where it gave 500 Internal server error.

4. Then I added **_EMP_ID=3710+AND+1=0 —_** , I noticed that in response the data is changed by adding.

5. By checking the behavior, further I used **SQLMAP** with the burp POST request, I got the below vulnerable payload which I tried in burp request and observed a delay as shown in the screenshot below.

**Vulnerable Payload:** EMP_ID=4727 AND 4900=DBMS_PIPE.RECEIVE_MESSAGE(CHR(114)||CHR(105)||CHR(105)||CHR(113),5)&LEVEL=UH&UNIT=BHAG

9. To retrieve the information, I saved the burp request and run the _SQLMAP_ using below command.

> **sqlmap -r burprequest.txt -technique=T — dbs**

By using the tool, I was able to retrieve the database and further sensitive information.

> **sqlmap -r burprequest.txt -technique=T -D <database_name> — tables**

Further, I tried extracting the details within the databases.

> **sqlmap -r burprequest.txt -technique=T -D <database_name> -T — columns**

At last I reported the vulnerability to the program with all the details and impact. Looking at the criticality the program responded back and within a day they fixed the issue.

**NOTE: Extracted data was deleted ;)**
